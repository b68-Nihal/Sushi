					<h3 style="text-align:center">Information :This page contains the similarities and the differences of the page from which we took refrences (which is on the left) and our webpage (which is on the right).</h3><br>
					<h1 style="text-align:center;">1. Navigation Bar Section</h1>
		<div class="rrow">
			<div class="rcol" style="text-align: center;">
					<a href="https://ktmmodelcollege.edu.np/"><img src="../images/kmc.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a>
					<a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/navbar.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a><br>
					<p class="researchtxt" style="text-align: center;">We liked how ktmmodelcollege.edu.np placed the navigation bar, including their logo and searchbar . Navigation Bar looked good as they placed their logo on the left. We  did the same to our website and put our logo in the left. We have only used 5 navigation links while KMC has used 6 . KMC has used icon for the search button whereas we have added placeholder in the search bar so that users can search the products they want to buy.[Click the Picture to go directly into the Website]</p>

		<h1 style="text-align:center;">2. Featured Products</h1>
		<div class="rrow">
			<div class="rcol" style="text-align:center;">
					<a href="https://www.gearfocus.com/"><img src="../images/gearfocus.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a>
					<a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/featured.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a><br>
					<p class="researchtxt" style="text-align: center;">We liked the basic and simplicity of the featured products from this particular website so we added similar featured products section on my Home page. We liked how that page arranged its products in a row along with their marked price and discounted price. Gearfocus.com have added four of their products on their featured products section while we added 5 products in that section of our page. We also added a button (Featured Products) which is linked to the product's page which is not used by gearfocus.com .[Click the Picture to go directly into the Website]</p>

<!--END OF second and start of third -->


		<h1 style="text-align:center;">3. Product Description Page</h1>
		<div class="rrow">
			<div class="rcol" style="text-align:center;">
					<a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><img src="../images/amazon.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a>
					<a href="product_description.html"><img src="../images/pd.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a><br>
					<p class="researchtxt" style="text-align: center;">We were inspired to make product description page from this particular website because this website had posted product image along with the details side by side. We also did the same in our website. The difference was made :We also kept two buttons (add to cart & buy now ) below the image of product along with pop-up alert function in the button. We also used flip image effect on hover which is not used by amazon.[Click the Picture to go directly into the Website]</p>

		<h1 style="text-align:center;">4.Banner in Product Page</h1>
		<div class="rrow">
			<div class="rcol" style="text-align:center;">
					<a href="https://www.fossil.com/"><img src="../images/fossil.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a>
					<a href="product.html"><img src="../images/mypage.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a><br>
					<p class="researchtxt" style="text-align: center;">We liked the idea how fossil.com kept an image banner on thier product page below the navigation bar. It made the page more attractive and eye-catchy. We also added an image of cameras as our banner. We excluded the buttons inside the image banner and kept it below instead. It made our page looked clean.[Click the Picture to go directly into the Website]</p>

		<h1 style="text-align:center;">5.Product Allignmment in Products Page</h1>
		<div class="rrow">
				<div class="rcol" style="text-align:center">
					<a href="https://www.fossil.com/"><img src="../images/prfossil.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a>
					<a href="product.html"><img src="../images/mypr.png" width="45%" height="85%"></a><br>
					<p class="researchtxt" style="text-align: center;"> Taking reference from this site 'fossil.com' helped us alot in alligning the products on our product page. The following website has kept 4 of their product's images aligned in a row whereas we kept 3 of our products in a particular row. We also added the "Buy Now " button below our products which is also different from the fossil's  website. We added box-shadow to place our products which is not used by fossil.com.
